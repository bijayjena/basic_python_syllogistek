Use case: Archival

You will need to use few python libraries including but not limited to:
	string
	randomn
	os
	shutil
	
to import some functions from the libraries use commands like
import random
or
from random import randint

once libraries are imported you can explore the functions available in the library using dir and help command.
ex - dir(random) => will give you list of all the functions available in random library.
	 help(random.randint) => shows one line description of the randint function in random library.
	 
In some location in your system use some function from the above libraries to create a folder named "all_files" 

ex - os.mkdir("all_files")

Now programatically create some random files in all_files folder:
ex - for file in ["jpg","png","txt","pdf"]:
		=> create 25 files of each file extension
		=> to create the file use open function and random library to generate some combination of file name
		ex of file name - AMP57BPC.txt 
		file name should be generated trough program by forming some random combination of string and number and adding the extension at the end of the file name.
		
Once files are generated:
	write a function that will create unique folders with extension name:
	ex - for above example it should generate 4 folders jpg png txt pdf.
	Handle through exceptions if folder already exists.
	
	write another function that will list all the files in all_files folder and pick each file and cut paste in respective folder.

Note - 	
	Follow programming and design standards with the use of right functions as needed.
	Proper use of data structures
	Exception handling
	Above are basic functionalities for your program.
	Identifiy more realtime issues and pain areas on similar lines and try to include in your code.
